# **Week 5: Coding begins**

## *Resources*

This week we begin coding the solver. Both of us are currently working on the getting inputs/outputs of the Mini Motorways game from/to the solver. By the time that work is finished others can go through the some basic libraries and softwares in python.

Each of following libraries have their purposes and vast documentations. So for now you can quickly go over each of them getting some idea about their features and syntax and later when you actually require them in your code then you can refer the docs.

1. [**Numpy**](https://numpy.org/) : Used for fast Linear Algebra related or Statistical computation.

2. [**Scipy**](https://scipy.org/) : Has many scientific computing modules.

3. [**Pandas**](https://pandas.pydata.org/) : Used for reading and formatting data from CSVs or spreadsheets.

4. [**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/) or [**Plotly**](https://plotly.com/): Used for plotting graphs.

5. [**Scikit-learn**](https://scikit-learn.org/) : Has many algorithms related to data science and commonly used datasets. Kind of like a learning laboratory for data science.
6. [**Pytorch**](https://pytorch.org/), [**Keras**](https://keras.io/), [**Tensorflow**](https://www.tensorflow.org/) : These are some of the industry level frameworks for working with Neural Networks. We will take a better look at these later on.
7. **Jupyter Notebook** : This is not a library but a modified version of python generally used to create pretty notebooks that display code and outputs together. There is VSCode extension for this so no need to install.
8. [**Google Colab**](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) : Similar to Jupyter this also creates notebooks but also provides remote runtimes with powerful processors.
9. **Matlab, Octave, etc.** : Now these are entire software that have all the above mentioned capabilities but have different languages than python so steep learning curves.
